# parameters of the lurking spot selection and update
lurking:
  z_offset: 0.2 # metres
  reaction_dist: 8.0 # metres - when the ball gets closer than this, start reacting to its predicted trajectory
  max_reposition: 6.0 # metres
  min_observing_duration: 60.0 # the target must be observed at least this amount of seconds to start lurking
  min_last_points: 10 # how many last points at minimum to use when RANSACing the lurking position - UNUSED
  min_last_duration: 3 # how many last sedonds at minimum to use when RANSACing the lurking position - UNUSED
  passthrough_detection_distance: 10.0 # metres - when distance of the ball is smaller, the signed distnace from YZ lurk plane will be used for detecting passthrough
  land_check: true
  land_after_first_passthrough: false

# parameters related to trajectory generation
trajectory:
  sampling_dt: 0.2 # seconds
  horizon: 8.0 # seconds
  target_reached_distance: 0.5 # metre - at this distance from the target point it is considered to be reached
  default_speed: 3.0 # metres per second - used for boring maneuvres (such as from obs. pos. to lurk pos.)

# height "pogoing" when waiting for the target to be first detected
